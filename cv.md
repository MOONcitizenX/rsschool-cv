## About:  
  
My goal is to become a front-end developer. Atm I don't have production experience but I'm willing to learn and develop my skills in software engineering. There's never a point when you can say "I've learned everything", so getting new skills is a must.  
  
## Skills:  

-   HTML basics  
-   CSS basics  
-   JavaScript basics  
-   Git, Github  
-   VSCode  
  
## Code examples:  
  
**Task example:**  
Given a string of digits, you should replace any digit below 5 with '0' and any digit 5 and above with '1'. Return the resulting string.  
 Note: input will never be an empty string  
  
```js
const fakeBin = (string) =>
	string  
		.split('')
		.map((el) => (el < 5 ? 0 : 1))
		.join('');
```
